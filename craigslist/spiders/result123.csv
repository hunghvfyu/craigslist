 One of New York City's leading professional firms dedicated to the restoration and renovation of buildings and infrastructure is currently seeking an architect with  2 to 5 years of relevant experience. 

SUPERSTRUCTURES works on an array of challenging projects on many of New York's most prominent buildings. We've won frequent awards, as well as the loyalty of some of the premier clients in the region -- public, corporate and residential.  Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure - facades, roofs, windows, and plazas - and the full complement of materials, from landmark terra cotta to high performance curtain walls.  

We work in teams. Teams are assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a ""small office experience"" coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state of the art non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques.  

Employees typically participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see the designs you draw executed in the field, and you'll take on greater responsibility and client exposure as soon as you are ready.  

Frequent lunchtime seminars by industry experts, including our own in-house personnel, keep us current on developments in the profession (with the additional benefit of a free lunch).  

SUPERSTRUCTURES offers top-level compensation for top-level people, and the advancement potential of a thriving company.  

We are committed to a work / life balance, and to a work week of 40 hours.  When, on occasion, more than 40 hours are required, our employees are compensated for every additional hour worked. 
Our benefits include paid holidays, vacation and sick days, health insurance for employee and family, 401(k) with automatic employer contribution, a continuing education allowance, and free NYC Transit MetroCards.  

Our light-filled office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and drop dead views in three directions - not a bad place to spend the workday. 

Our Tribeca location is one of New York City's most convenient and vibrant, easily accessible via public transportation. The A, C, and E subway lines stop right in the building. The N, R, #1, and #6 lines are each just a few blocks away. 

SUPERSTRUCTURES welcomes applications in reply to this posting. Please include a cover letter with salary requirements, your resume, and a few pages of attachments that display your capabilities (maximum of 10MB please).  

Note: Our thanks in advance to those submitting applications; only those candidates under consideration will be contacted.

We are seeking a motivated individual with strong electrical engineering knowledge and superior problem-solving skills.  Must have experience with fixing small electronics (i.e. cell phones, gaming consoles, PDA's, etc.) We are a growing online retail company specializing in consumer electronics, and we are looking forward to significant growth in 2017.

Throughout the course of our business as a trading company specializing in consumer electronics, we come across many items that are broken, DOA, or otherwise not 100% functional for one reason or another.  Many of these problems are very simple, and just requite a bit of tinkering (for example - a regular Alkaline battery exploded in the battery compartment, and the mainboard needs to be cleaned with alcohol; or, for example, some buttons are non-responsive, and the button's contacts with the circuit-board need to be realigned, etc.).  Other problems are more difficult, and require soldering, sourcing replacement components from China, thorough internet research and asking questions in the online-electronics-repair community, and possibly reprogramming or entirely replacing chips on the mainboard, such as the ASIC or Flash memory.

If hired, you will be responsible for helping us come up with solutions to help fix our inventory, for the actual fixing of products on a weekly basis, and for helping to train our support staff (so they can assist you with the more simple issues.)

Desired Skills:
-	Excellent problem solving skills!
-	Very familiar with soldering irons, multimeters, and other tools of the trade
-	Familiarity with online research, including repair sites such as Fixya.com, IFixIt.com, etc.
-	Experience with sourcing electric components from overseas
-	Bachelor or Associates Degree in Engineering (electrical or mechanical)
-	Excellent Communication Skills
-	Honesty & Integrity are paramount
-	Willingness to commit yourself to recurring six-month terms of employment

Compensation is based on ability and experience, however, there is MAJOR room for advancement for a skilled electrical engineer with good problem-solving ability (for example, if you attain the level of ability of our previous engineers, you could earn over $100,000/yr for part-time work).

This position has the option of being full=time or part-time.  We are located around the corner from McCarren Park in Williamsburg, close to the L and G subway lines. Very relaxed and casual work atmosphere; we work from 10am - 6pm, Monday through Friday, not on weekends and never on major holidays. (Plenty of optional overtime hours will be available during busy seasons.)

For consideration, please submit: 
- Current and complete resume
- 2-3 recent references from previous employers
- Paragraph detailing your electronics repair experience & qualifications
